- Don't write comments unless you are explicitly told to
- Favor refactor over creating new code
- Try to write the least code you can, less is more
- Since this is a Zig project and you have low knowledge of Zig, try to do simple things that you are very certain of
- Be assertive and precise not verbose
- Less code is better code, it's easier to understand
- Unless told so, dont touch in non functional parts of the code, like logging or comments
- Favor const
